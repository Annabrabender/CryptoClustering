# CryptoClustering


In this assignment I use my knowledge of Pyhton and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrancies are affected by 24 hour or 7 day price changes. 


Please find my code in the file called: CryptoClustering

The following I found in my analysis:
The best value for K using my original data: 4
The best value for K using PCA: 4
The variance between the three prinicpal compenents is 89.50%

* **Question:** After visually analyzing the cluster analysis results, what is the impact of using fewer features to cluster the data using K-Means?

  * **Answer:Using fewer features to cluster the data using KMeans results in clearer grouping with less overlap. The other impact is computational efficiency, using fewer features can lead to faster computation.
